                     "Owner" : "0782576847"\

                 The following will result into a bad request response.
                 
                 Account scheme provided is not any of the above schemes\
                 Wallet Type provided is not any of the above types,\
                 Account scheme does not match with the account type ie specified wallet Type as momo and provide a scheme of visa\
                 You are trying to create a duplicate wallet\
                 you are trying to create more than five wallets
                 
                 This method also returns an internal server error if something went wrong on the server side. So you may try again\
                 If all goes well, an id for the wallet created is returned with a server status of Created.\
                 For quick reference, it is better to store the id for future actions like deleting or getting it.
